Lending Club Case Study

Data Analysis Objectives:

The largest, single-source financial loss comes from lending to 'risky' applicants, known as credit loss. Credit loss refers to the amount of money lost by the lender when debtors refuse to pay or flee with the amount owed.

The ultimate objective is to classify applicants as risky or not. By reducing such loans, the amount of credit loss can be decreased. This case study aims to identify risky applicants using EDA.

Perform an analysis to understand the factors, or driver variables, behind loan defaults. These variables are strong indicators of default and can be used by the company for portfolio selection and risk analysis.
